## 🎯 About 
We are a community of learners passionate about understanding reinforcement learning from the ground up. Our approach:

- **Structured Learning**: Weekly agendas with clear objectives and success criteria
- **Active Discussion**: Peer-to-peer learning with immediate feedback
- **Collaborative Notes**: Knowledge consolidation and shared insights
- **Appropriate Challenges**: Current skill level + 10-20% stretch
- **Practical Implementation**: Code examples and experiments with peer review
- **Resource Sharing**: Curated collection of papers, books, and tutorials
- **Project Collaboration**: Real-world applications of what we learn
- **Simply show up**: Consistency beats perfection; come hang out
