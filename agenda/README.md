## 📋 How It Works

- **Weekly Plans**: Each file corresponds to a specific week's study plan
- **Shared Coordination**: All group members can see upcoming topics and schedules
- **Flexible Updates**: Agendas can be updated as we progress through the material
- **Leader Post**: Each agenda is posted by a designated leader

## 📝 File Naming Convention

Clear, descriptive names for agenda files, examples:
- `week1-introduction.md`
- `week2-qlearning.md`
- `week3-policy-gradients.md`
