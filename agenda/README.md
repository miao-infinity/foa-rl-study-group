## 📋 How It Works

- **Weekly Plans**: Each file corresponds to a specific week's study plan
- **Shared Coordination**: All group members can see upcoming topics and schedules
- **Flexible Updates**: Agendas can be updated as we progress through the material

## 📝 File Naming Convention

Use clear, descriptive names for agenda files:
- `week1-introduction.md`
- `week2-qlearning.md`
- `week3-policy-gradients.md`
- `week4-deep-rl.md`

## ⚖️ Difficulty Adjustment Guidelines

### Assessing Group Readiness
- **Pre-session Check**: "How confident are you with the prerequisites?"
- **Skill Level Survey**: Quick poll of current understanding
- **Previous Week Review**: Identify gaps that need addressing

### Adjusting Agenda Complexity
- **Too Easy**: Add advanced extensions and deeper theoretical discussions
- **Too Hard**: Include more foundational review and simplified examples
- **Mixed Levels**: Provide tiered exercises (basic/intermediate/advanced)

### Flexible Session Structure
- **Core Content**: Essential concepts everyone should master
- **Extension Activities**: Additional depth for those ready for more
- **Support Sessions**: Extra help for those struggling with prerequisites

## 🕐 Schedule Conflict Management

### Handling Conflicts
- **Advance Notice**: Post schedule changes at least 1 week ahead
- **Alternative Sessions**: Offer multiple time slots when possible
- **Asynchronous Options**: Provide materials for self-study when needed
- **Catch-up Sessions**: Schedule makeup sessions for missed content

### Communication Protocol
- **Schedule Updates**: Use GitHub issues to announce changes
- **Availability Polls**: Survey group for best meeting times
- **Flexible Participation**: Allow partial attendance when needed
- **Recording Sessions**: Consider recording for those who can't attend

### Priority Guidelines
- **Core Concepts**: Essential topics that build on each other
- **Optional Content**: Interesting but not prerequisite material
- **Review Sessions**: Important for reinforcing fundamentals
- **Project Work**: Can be done asynchronously with group check-ins
