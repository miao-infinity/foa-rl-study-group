## ðŸ’­ Discussion
- What makes RL different from supervised learning?
- Can you think of a real-world problem that could be solved with RL?
- What are the main challenges in RL?

## ðŸ’» Code
Simple implementation to try (optional):
- Set up a basic RL environment (like OpenAI Gym's CartPole)
- Run a random agent and observe how it performs
