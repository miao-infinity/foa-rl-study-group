## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Step 1: Create Your Folder
Create a folder with your **name or GitHub username**:
```
code/your-name/
```

**Examples:**
- `code/lee/`
- `code/example-user/`

### Step 2: Add Your Code Files
Add your **week-specific** code files to your folder:

**Examples:**
```
code/lee/
├── week1-qlearning.py
├── week2-policy-gradients.py
└── README.md (optional - describe your implementations)
```

### Step 3: Submit Your Work
1. Commit your changes
2. Open a Pull Request
3. Add a brief description of what you implemented

---

## 📝 File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `week1-qlearning.py`, `week2-policy-gradients.py`
- Include week numbers for easy reference
- Add a brief comment at the top of each file describing the implementation

---

## 🎯 What to Include

- **Working code examples** from weekly topics
- **Experiments** you've tried
- **Interesting variations** of algorithms
- **Helper functions** that might be useful to others
- **README files** explaining your approach

## 🔍 Code Review Process

### Before Submitting
- **Test your code**: Ensure it runs without errors
- **Add documentation**: Include comments explaining key parts
- **Check formatting**: Follow consistent style guidelines
- **Self-review**: Read through your code as if you're seeing it for the first time

### Review Guidelines
- **Be constructive**: Focus on improvement, not criticism
- **Ask questions**: If something isn't clear, ask for clarification
- **Suggest alternatives**: Offer different approaches when helpful
- **Celebrate good work**: Acknowledge well-written code and clever solutions

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Clear variable and function names
- [ ] Adequate comments and documentation
- [ ] Follows consistent formatting
- [ ] Includes example usage or tests
- [ ] README explains the approach and results

## 📋 Code Quality Standards

### Documentation
- **File headers**: Brief description of what the code does
- **Function docstrings**: Explain parameters, returns, and purpose
- **Inline comments**: Clarify complex logic or algorithms
- **README files**: Overview of your implementation approach

### Code Style
- **Consistent naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Proper indentation**: Follow language-specific conventions
- **Reasonable length**: Keep functions and classes focused and manageable
- **Error handling**: Include basic error checking where appropriate

### Best Practices
- **Modular design**: Break complex algorithms into smaller functions
- **Reusability**: Write code that others can easily understand and modify
- **Performance awareness**: Consider efficiency for larger datasets
- **Version control**: Use meaningful commit messages

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Basic Testing
- **Functionality**: Code should run and produce expected results
- **Edge cases**: Handle common error conditions gracefully
- **Documentation**: Include example usage or simple test cases

### Recommended Testing
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions when possible
- **Integration tests**: Verify that components work together
- **Performance tests**: Check runtime for larger inputs
- **Visualization**: Include plots or outputs when relevant

### Testing Guidelines
- **Keep it simple**: Focus on functionality over comprehensive coverage
- **Share results**: Include example outputs or performance metrics
- **Document issues**: Note any known limitations or edge cases
- **Iterate**: Update tests as you improve your implementations
